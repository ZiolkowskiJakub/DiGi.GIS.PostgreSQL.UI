    /// <para>Asks for the scope of one Year Built prediction run and nothing else: the counties, where its imagery goes, which interpreter runs the detector, and how hard the export leans on the server.</para>
    /// <para><b>A tray run has one shape - the full six step flow - and it writes.</b> The steps are not offered because they are not a choice here: ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI#8 made export, detector, detection write, score, history write and column write a single run per county precisely so that no step could be left out of sequence, and it decided that the granular flags stay on the options class and the console app for hand-driven diagnostics while the tray driven flow collapses them. Eight checkboxes offered two hundred and fifty six combinations, of which three were real - and the rest failed late, after the half hour of export and the hour and a half of inference had already been paid for. The OK handler writes all six on, so the run the operator gets is the run the standing recipe describes.</para>
    /// <para><b>What settles the model is deliberately not here either.</b> The weights, the confidence threshold, the year range and the radiuses all decide what the regressor is handed, and a value that disagrees with what it was trained on scores without failing - the predictions are worse by an amount nothing measures (ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.GIS.ML#6). They belong to the deployment and to the options file rather than to a dialog opened before every run. The working directory and the two batch sizes are out for a different reason: none of the three is a choice - see the comment in the OK handler.</para>
    /// <para>The scratch cleanup is the one flag that survives, because its reason is about this run rather than about the sequence: a cancelled county is cleaned, so a run that is meant to be interrupted has to be able to say so beforehand.</para>
    /// <para>The window works on a copy, so a cancelled dialog leaves the settings of an earlier run exactly as they were, and every member the window has no control for carries through untouched.</para>
