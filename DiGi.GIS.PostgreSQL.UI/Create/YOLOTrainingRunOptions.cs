        /// <para>Starts from a copy of <paramref name="yOLOTrainingRunOptions"/> - the run the operator had before - or from the class defaults, and overwrites only what the scenario decides, so the counties, the folders, the device and the interpreter survive a switch between scenarios:</para>
        /// <para><see cref="YOLOTrainingScenario.Retrain"/>: the start weights are the deployed model.pt, the epoch ceiling is 150, and the dataset folder is resumed (<see cref="YOLOTrainingDatasetOptions.Resume"/> on), so the chosen counties are appended to it.</para>
        /// <para><see cref="YOLOTrainingScenario.Fresh"/>: the start weights are the pretrained yolo26x.pt, the epoch ceiling is 300, and the dataset folder is not resumed, so the runner refuses a folder that already holds a dataset and the dataset is built fresh.</para>
        /// <para>Both weights files are named relative to the runner and resolved against it here (<see cref="Query.ConsoleAppFilePath(string?, string?)"/>), because the runner resolves a relative start path against its own directory and this application would otherwise check a different file. A file that is not found keeps the absolute path the runner's deployed layout gives it (<see cref="Query.ConsoleAppDeployedPath(string?, string?)"/>), so the preflight names the place it looked rather than a relative name.</para>
        /// <para>The dialog offers no control for most dataset members, and their class defaults are this surface's answer: the confidence, the split, the label check sizes, the legacy cut-off and the request sizes are the values the runner's README describes. Two defaults are set here rather than taken: <see cref="YOLOTrainingDatasetOptions.CountOnly"/> is forced off, because the committed runner template ships it on and a counting run trains nothing; and an empty <see cref="YOLOTrainingRunOptions.Steps"/> is replaced by all five steps written out, because the runner reads an empty list as "all steps" and the dialog would otherwise show no step ticked for a run that runs every one. <see cref="YOLOTrainingDatasetOptions.WeightsPaths"/> defaults to the incumbent model.pt; the runner adds the candidate itself.</para>
