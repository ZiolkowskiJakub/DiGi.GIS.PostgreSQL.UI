    /// <para><b>Two scenarios.</b> <see cref="YOLOTrainingScenario.Retrain"/> continues from the deployed model.pt and appends the chosen counties to the existing dataset folder; <see cref="YOLOTrainingScenario.Fresh"/> starts from the pretrained yolo26x.pt and builds the dataset fresh into a new folder. The scenario sets defaults only (<see cref="Create.YOLOTrainingRunOptions(YOLOTrainingScenario, string?, YOLOTrainingRunOptions?)"/>).</para>
    /// <para><b>The run happens in another process</b>, <c>DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI.ConsoleApp --train</c>, for the same reason as <see cref="UIYearBuiltPredictionsTask"/>: this application publishes self-contained and single-file and does not carry the runner's closure. The options are written beside the run folder - not inside it, because the runner refuses a run whose folder already exists - and that file is the record of what the run was asked to do, so it is never overwritten: a run with the Training step writes <c>&lt;RunName&gt;.YOLOTrainingRunOptions.json</c> (a taken run name is refused before launch), a resume writes <c>&lt;RunName&gt;.resume-&lt;yyyyMMdd_HHmmss&gt;.YOLOTrainingRunOptions.json</c> so the original run's file is untouched, and a run without training always writes <c>yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.YOLOTrainingRunOptions.json</c>, whatever the run name box says (<see cref="Create.YOLOTrainingRunOptionsFile(string, string?, bool, string, DateTimeOffset, bool)"/>).</para>
    /// <para><b>Every path is made absolute here</b>, against the runner for the files its defaults name (the weights, the legacy references, the reports folder) and against this process for the folders the operator typed, so the file the runner reads names what this application checked and named back.</para>
    /// <para><b>The run never overwrites model.pt.</b> The trained weights stay under the run folder and are copied to <c>&lt;ProjectDirectory&gt;\&lt;RunName&gt;\&lt;RunName&gt;.pt</c>; shipping or holding them is a manual decision from the evaluation table (ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI#12).</para>
    /// <para>The dataset step authorizes with <b>the runner's own key</b>, read from the <c>GIS_WebAPI_Client.conf</c> beside its executable - a run that ends in <see cref="YearBuiltPredictionExitCode.Authorization"/> is usually that file. <b>Stopping the task kills the process tree</b>, the interpreter included; the dataset manifest lets a Re-train run continue an interrupted build (a Start from yolo26x.pt run does not resume, so a fresh build that was stopped is continued as Re-train with the start weights set back to yolo26x.pt), and a training that was stopped or crashed is <b>offered for resume</b>: the dialog names its epoch and ceiling, the preflight repeats the runner's refusals before launch, and the resume continues <c>weights\last.pt</c> at the next epoch in the same folder. Closing this application or a power cut still stops the run - resume shortens the recovery, it does not prevent the interruption. A training that stalls while its runner is alive is also <b>resumed automatically</b>, up to <see cref="YOLOTrainingRunOptions.AutoResumeCount"/> times (the dialog offers 3) and after <see cref="YOLOTrainingRunOptions.InactivityTimeout"/> without output (15 minutes by default); a run that exhausts them fails with the last reason named, and a stop from the tray is never resumed.</para>
