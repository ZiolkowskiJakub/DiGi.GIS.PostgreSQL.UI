    /// A Year Built prediction run that is scoped from the user interface: the counties, the scratch directory, the interpreter, the request concurrency and the scratch cleanup are asked for through <see cref="YearBuiltPredictionsOptionsWindow"/> each time the task is started.
    /// <para><b>A tray run has one shape, and it writes.</b> The pipeline's steps are not offered - ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI#8 made the six of them a single run per county and left the granular flags to the options class and the console app - so the dialog settles the scope and the run does the rest. Because OK now means the deployed data of every county selected, the scope is named back in a confirmation before anything is launched.</para>
    /// <para><b>The run happens in another process.</b> The pipeline needs a regressor, and the only implementation of it carries the machine learning closure - about a gigabyte of native libraries, against an application that publishes self-contained and single-file. The <c>IYearBuiltPredictor</c> seam exists to keep that weight out of hosts that only need to start a run, so this task writes the options out and hands them to <c>DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI.ConsoleApp</c>, which already hosts the pipeline and is already exercised end to end.</para>
    /// <para>Two consequences of that are worth knowing before a run. <b>The runner authorizes with its own key</b>, read from the <c>GIS_WebAPI_Client.conf</c> beside its executable rather than from this application's - a run that ends in <see cref="YearBuiltPredictionExitCode.Authorization"/> is usually that file rather than the one this application uses. And <b>stopping the task kills the run rather than winding it down</b>: the whole process tree goes, the detector included, so a batch that was being written may be half written. Every step of the pipeline is idempotent and a stopped run is re-runnable, but its tallies are not a record of what was stored.</para>
    /// <para>The environment preflight runs here, before anything is launched, so a machine with no CPython carrying ultralytics says so in front of whoever opened the dialog instead of an hour later as an exit code. The pipeline repeats the check inside the run; that costs one interpreter start and is what makes the reason legible.</para>
    /// <para><b>Every refusal before launch names its reason on the task row.</b> Each check below runs before anything is started, logs its reason and throws a <see cref="BackgroundTaskFailureException"/> worded exactly as the log line (<see cref="Query.RenderRefusal(string, object[])"/> renders it), so nobody has to open the logs folder to learn why nothing started. A cancelled dialog or a declined confirmation is not a refusal - nobody scoped a run, so the task reports a completed run that started nothing. A run that fails after launch is reported with its exit code, the last <c>[ERROR]</c>/<c>[FATAL]</c> line the runner printed and the step that failed (<see cref="FailureMessage(YearBuiltPredictionExitCode, IEnumerable{string})"/>).</para>
