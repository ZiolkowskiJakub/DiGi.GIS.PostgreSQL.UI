    /// <para>For every county in scope the task pages through the county's <see cref="Building2DReference"/> records and, per page, downloads the <see cref="GIS.Classes.Building2D"/> data, so a whole county's buildings are never held in memory at once.</para>

A 2D building whose reference has no stored CityGML building, no reference at all, or whose pull fails is modelled from an extruded footprint instead.</para>
    /// <para><b>"County" here means one polygon part.</b> The county listing returns 406 references for 380 codes, because a county whose territory is disconnected is stored as one row per part. The task reads and uploads by <c>Id</c>, so each part is filled from its own <c>building_2d</c> rows; uploading by <c>Code</c> instead would let the server file every part's models under a single one, which is what left three counties reading back empty. The county code is still written onto each model as descriptive metadata.</para>
    /// <para>Because <c>building_2d</c> holds the same building under every part it was imported under, a building shared by two parts is modelled once per part. That is inherent to keying by part and is not a duplicate to suppress here - it mirrors the underlying table.</para>
    /// <para><b>A national pass takes days, so a county is the unit of both failure and progress.</b> A county whose pages cannot be read or uploaded is named, recorded in <c>BuildingModels_Regeneration_Failed.txt</c> and skipped, rather than ending the run and discarding every county after it.
